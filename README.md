# Logistic Regression
Working with machine learning

Logistic regression fits a logistic model to data and makes predictions about the probability of an event (between 0 and 1).

This script displays the fitting of a logistic regression model to the iris dataset. Because this is a multi-class classification problem and logistic regression makes predictions between 0 and 1, a one-vs-all scheme is used (one model per class).
